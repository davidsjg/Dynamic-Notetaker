# Dynamic-Notetaker

Title: Dynamic-Notetaker

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, EXPRESS, NODEMON

Introduction: This code refactor creates a dynmic notepad that is stored on an Express server.

Scope of Functionality: The goal of this refactor was to create a dynamic notepad that would allow the user to enter a note title and associated note text. Once the note was filled out, a save button allows the user to store the note on the server. The note is also displayed in a left-hand column with other previously entered notes. The notes may be repopulated into the main body of the page, or deleted from the left hand column.

Problems Faced: Much cross-refrencing of pages provided problems.

Potential Future Plans: Have date and time associated with notes.
